# What is this API?

Microsoft Unified Communications Web API 1.0 is a REST API that exposes Lync Server 2013 instant messaging (IM) and presence capabilities.

**Last modified:** July 01, 2013

***Applies to:** Lync Server 2013*

UCWA 1.0 is a REST API that exposes Lync Server 2013 IM and presence capabilities. It enables developers to make their enterprise applications and intranets more lively and connected to business contacts.

Key use cases that are enabled by this API include the following.

  - Allow **Anonymous Web Chat** so that your customers can interact on your website or mobile app with customer service representatives.

  - Light up Lync presence in **Line-of-Business Applications** and intranets.

  - Embed **Cross-Platform** communication experiences across browsers and devices.

Although UCWA 1.0 is language-independent, developers can use any programming language from C/C++ to Java, the API is fine-tuned for web developers who are familiar with ordinary web technologies such as HTTP, OAuth, JSON, and JavaScript.

UCWA 1.0 is available only to customers who have Lync on-premises.

## Key scenarios

### Anonymous web chat

An increasing number of online shoppers believe the \#1 feature of an e-commerce site is the ability to chat with a rep in real-time. Mobile users also expect support from within apps. The combination of UCWA 1.0 and [UCMA 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35463) gives you the tools to delight your website visitors and mobile app users with a seamless customer care experience.

### Line-of-Business applications

Want to IM the author of a shared document to ask a question? Or maybe get in touch with the most recent editor of a customer list in your CRM app? UCWA 1.0 enables the seamless embedding of contact card, photos, and more into line-of-business applications, providing a consistent, people-centric experience powered by the same Lync Server already used within the organization.

### Cross-platform

Need presence on a Surface? Or contact list on Windows Phone? Have a sizable customer base browsing your site with non-Windows machines? As an HTTP-based Web API, UCWA 1.0 can be used from any language and any platform, as long as there is an HTTP stack available. Data is transferred as XML or JSON, both of which are consumable by a wide variety of languages.
